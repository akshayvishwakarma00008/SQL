Q1 - Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


Solutuon - 
select 
    case
        when a+b <= c OR b+c <= a OR a+c <= b then 'Not A Triangle'
        when a=b AND b=c then 'Equilateral'
        when a=b OR b=c OR a=c then 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END as type_of_triangle
